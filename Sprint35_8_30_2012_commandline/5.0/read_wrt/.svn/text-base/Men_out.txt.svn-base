Loosing traces :
Wolfgang,   It sounds like there must be some design-rule set in your
design that is not allowing all traces to be read in.
Try this:
1. once your in layout, turn checking off.
2. select the following menu: "setup placement>interactive
placement>attempt reconnect"  then click on "rip up segments only" , OK.

3. then use the restore traces command and click on  "replace existing
traces", "fix improperly connected routing", "remove duplicate routing".



good luck,

  The rules for PADSTACK layers are:

  1. SMD pads PAD is the layer to use
  2. For thruhole SIGNAL is the layer to use.

	ROUTING_LAYERS 4 = signal layers

	define_physical_layer(1,"PHYSICAL_1",SIGNAL_1, PAD_1");
	define_physical_layer(2,"PHYSICAL_2",SIGNAL_2");
	define_physical_layer(3,"PHYSICAL_3",POWER_1");
	define_physical_layer(4,"PHYSICAL_4",POWER_2");
	define_physical_layer(5,"PHYSICAL_5",SIGNAL_3");
	define_physical_layer(6,"PHYSICAL_6",SIGNAL_4, PAD_2");


	XRF	1	SIGNAL_1
	XRF	2	SIGNAL_2
	XRF	3	POWER_1
	XRF	4	POWER_2
	XRF	5	SIGNAL_3
	XRF	6	SIGNAL_4

In Mentor librarian we can have minimum .0001 inch
grid OR .00001 mm grid. Below this prcision lost.

It is essential to have some work around conversion
of values from inches to mm or vice versa.

We can use highly precise values in Librarian. But
if same pricision level used in layout / fablink, 
creates problems like memory requirement,large size
of GERBER files, defining apertures etc.

Please have a look to example given in below table:

Conversion         tol.    Conversion         tol.
inches to mm      0.01mm   mm to inches       0.001"

.001 = .0254      0.025     0.025 = .000984   0.001

2.021 = 51.3334   51.33    51.33 = 2.0208661  2.021

Short Desc:          Methodology for generating split planes for analysis


===============================================

Board Station accepts several different ways of configuring split power
planes. What methodology will ensure best results during auto-routing,
testpoint generation, high speed analysis, signal integrity analysis,
and post-process artwork checking?



===============================================
Solution Text:
-----------------------------------------------


The system accepts several different ways of configuring split planes. The
following is the Mentor Graphics supported methodology which ensures best
results during auto-routing, testpoint generation, high speed analysis,
signal integrity analysis, and post-process artwork checking.

Each individual net which appears on a power plane layer must be specified
using the power_net_names attribute in the board geometry. This can be
accomplished by using the Change Geometry function for the board geometry
in Librarian. If the same net is used many times, then specify it the same
number of times.

Organize the power net names in the power net statement grouped in the order
they will use power_n layers separated by commas which indicate layer
separations. Such as:

vcc /phy/crm/syvcc gnd_3, gnd_2 ground gnd_3, vcc3_3v gnd_3, ground gnd_3


Net 'vcc' maps to power_1, net '/phy/crm/syvcc' maps to power_2, net 'gnd_3'
maps to power_3, etc.

This is done all on one line in the create/change board part pop-up (even
though the system will show a second line leave it blank).

The viewing layer is the first power plane layer for each group as defined in
the artwork order. Be sure the power net name used on multiple split power
planes is not defined as the viewing layer of a split power plane more than
once in the artwork order. This ensures that each power fill generates
successfully.

In the example power net names list above, the second net names group (gnd_2
ground gnd_3) contains ground, and the fourth net names group (ground gnd_3)
also contains ground. Net ground will not be associated with the first or
viewing layer more than once. This allows different power net names to be the
viewing layers and results in all the power fills and artwork generating correctly.

Next, use the 'Physical Layers>Set Up Physical Layers'  menu pick to create as
many power_n layers as there are net names specified in the power net names
statement on the board part.

Then create the artwork order part the example as shown below illustrates.
Take care to organize the power layers in order. If you need to add a layer
later, redo the layers stackup so they stay in order.

  1 signal_1, pad_1
  2 power_1, power_2, power_3
  3 power_4, power_5, power_6
  4 power_7, power_8
  5 power_9, power_10
  6 signal_2, pad_2

The following table illustrates an example logical layer/net name/physical
layer matrix;


     Logical   Net Name         Physical
   -
1 |  signal_1,pad_1             phys1
   -
  |  power_1*  VCC              phys2_vcc
2 |  power_2   /phy/crm/syvcc   phys2_syvcc
  |  power_3   gnd_3            phys2_gnd3
   -
  |  power_4*  gnd2             phys3_gnd2
3 |  power_5   ground           phys3_ground
  |  power_6   gnd_3            phys3_gnd3
   -
4 |  power_7*  vcc3_3v          phys4_vcc3_3v
  |  power_8   gnd3             phys4_gnd3
   -
5 |  power_9*  ground           phys5_ground
  |  power_10  gnd_3            phys5_gnd3
   -
6 |  signal_2,pad_2             phys6
   -
           *viewing layer for each group

Now add the split power planes in Layout or Fablink as described in the
'Fablink Users Manual V8.4_3' beginning on page 4-176.

Be aware that in some versions of Board Station before 8.3x there is a
bug with power planes which are completely enclosed within larger
planes.

     ---------------------
    |         B           |
    |                     |
    |     ----------      |
    |    |          |     |
    |    |    A     |     |
    |    |          |     |
    |     ----------      |
    |                     |
     ---------------------

In the above example a power fill of net A is completely enclosed by another
power fill of net B; if the power fill of net A contains pins and/or vias
belonging to net B, then those pins and/or vias are not cleared but
shorted to net A in the artwork.

The workaround for this problem is to create the power fills so that one fill
does not fully contain another fill inside of it. This requires either
digitizing a gap when creating theoutside power fill or adding a power fill
cutout to the existing outside power fill. For example;

     -------   -----------
    |       | |  B        |
    |       | |           |
    |     ----------      |
    |    |          |     |
    |    |    A     |     |
    |    |          |     |
    |     ----------      |
    |                     |
     ---------------------

Power fill checking;

Menu pick 'Check>Power Fills on Physical Layers' in Layout or Fablink must be
performed after creating split power planes or after performing any
modifications to a design after the power fills have been added to the design.
This restructures the power fills if necessary in order to eliminate any
potential shorts within the power fill areas, and reportson any pins and vias
disconnected from the power fills.  The system does NOT automatically
restructure power fills if changes were made to the layout after the power
fills were created. Some examples of these changes are adding new vias or
moving components. A separate 'Check>Power Fills on Physical Layers' command
must be issued for each power plane viewing layer in the stackup.

Check power fills by connectivity does not restructure the power fills
and only reports on pins and vias not contained within their respective
power fill
