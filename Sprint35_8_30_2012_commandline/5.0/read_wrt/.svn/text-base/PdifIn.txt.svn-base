correct_viapadname() renames via geometries form "1" and deletes old geometry


	The theory is			     
	1. All blocks are global
	2. A geometry file must be loaded first - create board is the file 
	3. All file headers are check in the first line for file type and must follow Mentor spec
	4. All create views are also files
	5. Create Panels are also files
							 												 
																	  
   What's missing 			 
	- Text justificstion
	- LAY_MIRROR_ONLY		this are layers which are mirrored special
	  LAY_MIRROR_NEVER
   - all attributes
	- Component names from create_comp and cmp file.
	- Wire file.

	All blocks have -1 filenumber, because files, blocks and references can come in any order 
	and different files.


   pcad.c
   Converts P-Cad PDIF files -> laydbase files.

   Padstack definition per PCAD
   Pt 0        =  always via, not used in Compdef. Always called PADn or n.
   Pt 1 - 24   =  through hole pins
   Pt 25 - 50  =  Smd pins (not used in Parts)
   Pt 51 - 99  =  Vias not used in parts. Always called PADn or n.
   pt 100 - 999=  User assigned pin types which are smd.

   TEXTCORRECT:   Pcad text 100mil is actually 75 mil height
