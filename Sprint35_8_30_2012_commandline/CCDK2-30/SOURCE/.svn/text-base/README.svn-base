The following batch files build the CCDK libraries.  For each 
compiler, two libraries are built: one with spline code, and one 
without.

ccbc45.bat          - Borland 3.1 and 4.x

ccms80r.bat         - Microsoft C/C++ 8.0 16-bit (MSVC 1.5x) for DOS

ccms80rw.bat        - Microsoft C/C++ 8.0 16-bit (MSVC 1.5x) for Windows 3.1

ccms91s.bat         - Microsoft C/C++ 8.0/9.x 32-bit (MSVC 1.0/2.x) 
                      for DOS; requires Phar Lap TNT DOS Extender

ccms91sw.bat        - Microsoft C/C++ 8.0/9.x 32-bit (MSVC 1.0/2.x) 
                      for Windows (Win32s, Windows NT and Windows 95)

ccw105.bat          - WATCOM C/C++ 9.x/10.x (32-bit) for Extended DOS


The library names are encoded as follows:

N+S+C+[W]

where   N   denotes CCDK edition (2 => CCDK / 2D)

        S   denotes spline/non-spline (n=>spline support is disabled
            s=>spline support is enabled)

        C   denotes compiler (bc45=>Borland 3.1/4.x, 
            ms80r=>Microsoft 8.0 16-bit, 
            ms91s=>Microsoft 8.0/9.x 32-bit, 
            w105=>WATCOM 9.x/10.x)

        W   denotes "compiled for Windows" (w=>Windows support is 
            enabled)
 
For example,

2sm91sw.lib (2+s+m91s+w)

is the CAD/CAM Developer's Kit /2D library with spline and Windows 
code enabled for the Microsoft C/C++ 8.0/9.x 32-bit compiler.

Once you have built object libraries for your compiler, run the 
batch files in the samples directories to test your installation and 
begin programming with the CAD/CAM Developer's Kit / 2D.

We hope you save thousands of hours of time, effort and expense by 
using CCDK.  For support or upgrades, call Building Block Software
