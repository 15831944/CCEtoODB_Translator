The following batch files build the CCDK libraries.  For each 
compiler, two libraries are built: one with spline code, and one 
without.

ccbc45.bat          - Borland 3.1 and 4.x

ccms80s.bat         - Microsoft C/C++ 8.0 32-bit (MSVC 1.0) for DOS; 
                      requires Phar Lap TNT DOS Extender

ccms80sw.bat        - Microsoft C/C++ 8.0 32-bit (MSVC 1.0) for 
                      Windows (Win32s, Windows NT and Windows 95)

ccms91s.bat         - Microsoft C/C++ 9.x 32-bit (MSVC 2.x) 
                      for DOS; requires Phar Lap TNT DOS Extender

ccms91sw.bat        - Microsoft C/C++ 9.x 32-bit (MSVC 2.x) 
                      for Windows (Win32s, Windows NT and Windows 95)

ccw105.bat          - WATCOM C/C++ 9.x/10.x (32-bit) for Extended DOS

ccdk2.bat           - creates environment variable CCDK2 needed in the above
                      batch files


For the batch files to run properly, you must define an environment variable 
name CCDK2 which is set to your CAD/CAM Developer's Kit/2D root directory.  
The default name, c:\ccdk2-30, can be set using CCDK2.BAT.


The library names are encoded as follows:

N+S+C+[W]

where   N   denotes CCDK edition (M => CCDK / Milling)

        S   denotes spline/non-spline (n=>spline support is disabled
            s=>spline support is enabled)

        C   denotes compiler (bc45=>Borland 3.1/4.x, 
            ms80s=>Microsoft 8.0 32-bit, 
            ms91s=>Microsoft 9.x 32-bit, 
            w105=>WATCOM 9.x/10.x)

        W   denotes "compiled for Windows" (w=>Windows support is 
            enabled)
 
For example,

nsm91sw.lib (2+s+m91s+w)

is the "CAD/CAM Developer's Kit / Milling" library with spline and 
Windows code enabled for the Microsoft C/C++ 9.x 32-bit compiler. 

Once you have built object libraries for your compiler, run the 
batch files in the samples directories to test your installation and 
begin programming with the "CAD/CAM Developer's Kit / Milling". 

We hope you save thousands of hours of time, effort and expense by 
using CCDK.  For support or upgrades, call Building Block Software
